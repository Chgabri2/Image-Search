# This repository is based on Argmax Hiring Process Assignment 

This repository contains my personal implementation of the home assignment provided as part of the hiring process for Argmax company.
I did not officially submit this assignment, but I completed it independently after the deadline as a means of assessing
my skills and capabilities in relation to the job requirements.


### Assignment Information

The assignment revolved around building a recommendation system that could handle search queries based on either text or image input. 
The system employed the CLIP model to generate embeddings for both text and image data. 
By calculating the similarity between embeddings, the system could provide relevant recommendations based on user queries.


### Repository Structure

The repository forked from https://github.com/argmaxml/image-search 
containing almost all files, including the website for the search engine.
My role in the repository was to use the CLIP model and the vecsim library in order to implement the recommmandation system.
